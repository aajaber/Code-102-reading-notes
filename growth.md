# What is Growth Mindset?

**Growth Mindset:** “In a *growth mindset*, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.”

**“It's never too late to learn.”**

**“It's ok if I fail, at least I learned something.”**

**“I appreciate constructive criticism.”**

**“I can always improve at something if I try.”**
