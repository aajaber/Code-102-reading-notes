# Read: 05 - Operators and Loops

## Operators:
There are many types of Operators that we can use in JS.
**Like:**

**1- Comparison Operators**

**<** : greater than.

**>** : less than.

**=** : equals.

**2- Logical Operators**

*And* / **&&** :  used to combain two or more conditions (and all  of them must be true to get true as a result any false value will effect the final result).

*or* / **||** :  unlike  &&  in order to get false in the final result all the valuse must be false , otherwise we will get true.

*not* / **!** : the opposite of the current value **ex:**
!true =false, !false=true.





## Operators:

**for loop**:

** syntax**:

number=5

 for (var i = 1; i < number ; i++) {
    **loop body**
 }

- its better to be used when the we know the loop should be excute for (n) times (specific times).





**while loop**:

** syntax**:

while(CONDITION)
{

**LOOP BODY**

  break;

}

 - its better to be used when we deal with a user input.
